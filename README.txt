The code uses a multinomial classification Naive Bayes (bag of words) approach which ignores the order of words. This is a first draft of the code and can be certainly improved upon using more refined features and better learning techniques.

Currently the following needs to be done to run the code:

1) Create a folder called "Datasets" wherever the Niki.py file is placed, and place the "LabelledData.txt" file there. The code currently looks for the training data at this path.
2) On terminal, just do "python Niki.py". This will display the accuracy of the model on the current training set.


The code will be made more interactive to test easily for different test and train sets.

Thanks for reading.
